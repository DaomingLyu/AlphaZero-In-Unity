# AlphaZero-In-Unity
Several board game AI, which are trained based on AlphaZero, used in a Unity game.

I write a simple AlphaZero framework, implement ConnectFour AI, Reversi AI, Gobang AI, and create a unity game to play with those AI.

AlphaZero algorithm is based on two papers: Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge, Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.

我写了一个简单的AlphaZero框架，实现了四子棋AI，翻转棋AI，五子棋AI，并创建了一个可以和这些AI下棋的unity游戏。

AlphaZero算法基于两篇论文：Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge, Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.
