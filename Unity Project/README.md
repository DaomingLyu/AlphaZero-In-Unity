# The Unity project for AlphaZero-In-Unity

## Requirements

* Unity 2018.2.11f1
* Unity TensorFlow Plugin

This Unity project requires Unity TensorFlow Plugin to work. Since it is too big, I didn't upload it.

Its download link is in the documentation: [Using-TensorFlow-Sharp-in-Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/0.5.0/docs/Using-TensorFlow-Sharp-in-Unity.md)
